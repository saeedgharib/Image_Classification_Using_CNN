# Image_Classification_Using_CNN
Implemented a robust image classification system using CNN to accurately classify images into predefined categories.

#**To Run the application based on the model just run the application.py file**

# Steps
1.	Run the python code in LabFinal file it will use CNN and dataset cifar-10 to train our model by iterating 50 times through the dataset and our model is saved to be used in application.
2.	Now in application directory in Zip folder run application.py to run the application in localhost.
3.	Choose image and click on predict it will predict using the model we saved and provide you the results
